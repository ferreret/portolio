# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install       # Install dependencies
npm run dev       # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build     # Production build (output: dist/)
npm run preview   # Preview production build locally
```

There are no tests or linting configured.

## Architecture

Single-page portfolio app built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite. Routing is handled by React Router (`/`, `/projects`, `/projects/:id`, `/blog`, `/blog/:id`).

### Content system

All portfolio content lives in `contentData.ts`, which exports `{ en, es }` — two full `AppContent` objects for English and Spanish. The active language is selected at runtime and passed as `data` throughout the app.

Projects and blog articles are defined as bilingual `{ en, es }` objects in separate files:
- `data/projects/*.ts` — each exports a `ProjectItem` pair
- `data/articles/*.ts` — each exports a `BlogPost` pair

These are imported and assembled in `contentData.ts`. To add a new project or article, create a file in the appropriate `data/` subfolder and import it in `contentData.ts`.

All TypeScript interfaces are in `types.ts` (`AppContent`, `ProjectItem`, `BlogPost`, `ExperienceItem`, etc.).

### Case-study project schema

`ProjectItem` supports an extended schema for case studies (all fields optional):
- `status`: `'production' | 'prototype' | 'archived' | 'in-development'`
- `role`, `timeline`: short strings rendered in the project meta block
- `problem`, `solution`: plain-text paragraphs (whitespace preserved)
- `businessMetrics`: `{ label, value }[]` — rendered as cards at the top
- `architectureDiagram`: path to an image in `public/`
- `techStack`: `{ category, items }[]`
- `lessonsLearned`: `string[]`
- `content` (HTML string) remains as a fallback but prefer structured fields for new projects

Section labels used by `ProjectDetail` are bilingual in `AppContent.ui.caseStudy`.

### App structure

`App.tsx` is the top-level layout + router. Views live in `components/` (`HomeView`, `ProjectsView`, `ProjectDetail`, `BlogView`, `BlogPostDetail`, `Header`, `Footer`, `GitHubStats`, `Icons`). The `useFadeInOnScroll` hook lives in `hooks/`.

## Adding a new project or article

The preferred workflow uses the project-local Claude Code skills (in `.claude/skills/`):

1. **`add-content-item`** — scaffolds the bilingual data file in `data/projects/<slug>.ts` or `data/articles/<slug>.ts` with the full extended schema as placeholders, computes the next `id`, and wires imports + arrays in `contentData.ts`. Never fills fields with invented content.
2. The user fills in one language with **real** content (no made-up metrics, quotes, or post-mortems).
3. **`sync-bilingual`** — produces the other-language version, preserving HTML parity, glossary terms, and number format conventions (`19,776` vs `19.776`).
4. **`bilingual-content-reviewer` subagent** — final parity + fabrication audit before commit.

The `tsc-on-edit` hook (`.claude/hooks/tsc-on-edit.sh`) runs `tsc --noEmit` on every edit to `.ts`/`.tsx` files as the quality gate. There are no tests or linting beyond this.

**Hard rule**: portfolio content (projects, metrics, testimonials, posts) is always real and user-provided. Claude prepares the infrastructure; the user provides the substance. See `~/.claude/.../memory/feedback_no_fake_content.md`.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS v4 via PostCSS (configured in `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.ts`). Custom animations (`animate-fade-in-up`, `animate-soft-ping`, etc.) are defined in `styles.css`. The `dark` class on `<html>` drives dark mode via Tailwind's `dark:` variant.

### Static assets

`/cv.pdf` and `/profile.png` are served from the `public/` directory and referenced directly by path in `App.tsx`.

### Path alias

`@` resolves to the project root (configured in `vite.config.ts`).
